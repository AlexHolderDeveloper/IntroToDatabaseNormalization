# Unnormalized Form

This page is a look at the worst possible way to organize data: the 0NF. It's common to see this used when developers never actually learned how to use structured databases. It's rare in a professional setting.

## Description

Unnormalized form (or UNF, or 0NF) is a simple database data model that is just outright poorly-designed, badly-optimized, and often full of redundant or unnecessary data. It's not good. You should avoid this as much as possible - and if you've studied structured databases (eg. SQL) or software development frameworks that connect to databases (eg. Ruby on Rails) then you likely already have this drilled out of your head anyway. 

It's common to see 0NF structures in things like JSON messages. If an API is sending a JSON object out to an application, that object needs to have all of its data contained within itself. If it doesn't, there's no guarantee that the application receiving the JSON message will be able to understand the information properly. This can cause 0NF entities to contain lots of nested data or nested objects, as well as high amounts of redundancy. You'll see this a lot in NoSQL systems as each document has no relation to anything else - so, 0NF is not relational! It's a poor fit for structured or SQL-based systems due to this.



## Rules

- Make each row in the 0NF table as self-sufficient as possible



## Advantages

- Useful for treating objects as rows of a database
- Can be simpler to query as the entity that you're querying usually only needs to look at its own fields, not at other rows of data in the table



## Disadvantages

- Common to see each row packed with redundant & repeated data
- CRUD operations can have lots of room for human error due to the amount of data often created in a single action
- Uses way more memory & storage space



## Example

Here's an example of a 0NF-level table:





And as JSON:





And specifically why it's in 0NF:

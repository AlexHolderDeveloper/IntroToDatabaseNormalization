# 1NF - First Normal Form

This is the most bare-minimum version of database normalization, where duplicate data & collections of data no longer exist. Instead, you have more and more rows of data. 



## Description

1NF is a mostly-messy form of database normalization, but it's still at least structuring your data in a good, usable way. If 0NF is like a big fat JSON object, 1NF is like a basic Excel spreadsheet. It's structured, but not necessarily optimized & contains a ton of room for improvement.



## Rules

- Each column of each table contains an atomic value - no collections such as arrays or lists are allowed.
  - Less of an official rule but more of a "better design" thing: don't try to cheat the atomicity rule by creating numbered columns to act as collections. For example, don't have tables with columns like "Hobby 1, Hobby 2, Hobby 3". 
- The database uses tables logically for multiple tables-worth of data. (Compared to 0NF, which is more like throwing everything into a single self-contained JSON object!)
- There are no duplicate rows of data. Individual values in columns can be duplicated, but not whole rows.



## Advantages

- Better data optimization. 
  - A reference to another table takes up fewer bytes of hard drive space & RAM space compared to repeatedly storing identical data. Did you know that in some programming languages & systems, strings can be up to 2GB in size? Imagine if you had duplicate strings -- 4 copies of a max-size string is 8GB, but 4 references to one 2GB string would take 2.000000000001GB.
- Better security & fine-grain control over data access.
  - If you had all pieces of data accessible in a single table, you must use the same access rules across your whole database. If you're working with some private data & some public data, this means even your private data would be exposed to the public - and that's really bad. Separating data into multiple tables allows you to set up various levels of access & security across your database and/or API, allowing you to protect your data more-effectively.
- Better developer experience when working with the database. 
  - Compared to 0NF at least! Instead of working with a massive object of data to get some specific piece of info, you can just access that table for solely that piece of data. More-controlled database access means less room for human error, such as trying to read the wrong property name or set the wrong value to a property.



## Disadvantages

- Still clunky to work with, as former-arrays or collections are now spread across multiple rows. Working with databases at 1NF get messy, fast! 



## Example

Here's an example of a 0NF-level table that we'll convert into 1NF:

Here's how that database would look as a 1NF database:

It's got waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more rows in the main Hero table, but at least it hits 1NF! 1NF has some clear improvements over 0NF, but it's still not great. 

Here's a specific explanation of how this database is now 1NF: 

* Every row of every table in this database contains only single-value properties. No collections! No arrays, lists, or anything like that. 
  * This means that every row is ***atomic*** - a fancy term for saying there are no collections in your database.
  * This also causes ***the row-bloat problem***. To represent every hero accurately, you must create many almost-duplicate rows of data. But as long as at least one column of every row is different & none of the columns hold collections of data, then that meets the requirements of 1NF atomicity. It's not good. 2NF solves this with ***join tables***.
* Other than the duplicate data introduced by the row-bloat problem mentioned above, there is no duplicate data in this database. (So technically this example isn't 1NF due to that, but ssshhh!). Usage of foreign keys helps minimize data duplication - this means your database should take up less space on the hard drive of whatever the database is stored on, reducing project hardware/deployment costs!
